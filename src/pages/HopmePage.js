            <h2><span> What is your acheivement?</span></h2>
            <p> One of the big car companies in CA asked us to create a customization 
                online ad that used the map API. The challenge was the key use case for
                using mapp API to render the sponsored location by zipcode was not supported
                by our ad template solution. It would require an enhancement to the existing 
                template functionality.<br/>
                Given the important of the revenue for the CA's market, I went to do a deep
                research on how the map api worked within this ad template. I found a way
                to implement the solution and immediately create a demo and have a QA team  
                ran a test. <br/>
                The campaign went live with the solution I implemented and the client add more budget 
                to spend on this running campaign by 30%.
